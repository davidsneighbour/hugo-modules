## returns the article image for the given context as a resource object or an empty dictionary

- this tag might end up very resource intense when the most common (low number) settings aren't used, so use with caution and cached. cacheid should be article id.

### path of checking (immediate return on any succesful hit, not checked lines are not implemented yet)

1. [x] check for an image `header.(png/jpg/gif/svg)` in the leaf bundle

2. [ ] check for frontmatter `headerimage`
  - [ ] if it's an URL use that
  - [ ] looks for the image in `assets/`
  - [ ] looks for the image in `static/`
  - [ ] ignores the frontmatter if not found

3. [ ] check for `tags`, then `keywords` frontmatter and
  - [ ] check if the tag or keyword coming FIFO has a default image associated with it

4. [ ] check for resources that are images
  - [ ] check for an image that has `params` `mainimage` set to `true` (if multiple items exist then the first one is used)
  - [x] takes the first image of the resources array
  - [ ] note: if there is no resources frontmatter it will still use the first image resource found in the page leaf. To stop this add frontmatter `use_resource` with `false`.

5. [ ] check for configuration parameter `[params.dnb.pictures] > default_headerimage` and
  - [ ] if it's an URL use that
  - [ ] looks for the image in `assets/`
  - [ ] looks for the image in `static/`

### Notes:
- if the file found is in resources or `assets` then it will be preprocessed and return a responsive pictures tag
- if the file found is in `static` then it will be inserted as is or per configuration (see below)

### TODO:
- notes about configuration of responsive sizes
- notes about configuration of default sizes

### Input

the page object to extract the image for.

### Output

dictionary with

- image: information about the image (src, name, description, params)
- isResource: boolean denoting if the image can be pushed through resize/optimise procedures or is singular static image
- properties: (properties of a singular static image)
  - width
  - height
  - description
