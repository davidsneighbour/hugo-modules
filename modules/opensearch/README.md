This is a Hugo theme component that adds an open search configuration file to your website.

## Some things you need to know

These are notes about conventions in this README.md. You might want to make yourself acquainted with them if this is your first visit.

<details>

<summary>:heavy_exclamation_mark: A note about proper configuration formatting. Click to expand!</summary>

The following documentation will refer to all configuration parameters in TOML format and with the assumption of a configuration file for your project at `/config.toml`. There are various formats of configurations (TOML/YAML/JSON) and multiple locations your configuration can reside (config file or config directory). Note that in the case of a config directory the section headers of all samples need to have the respective section title removed. So `[params.dnb.something]` will become `[dnb.something]` if the configuration is done in the file `/config/$CONFIGNAME/params.toml`.

## Installing

First enable modules in your own repository if you did not already have done so:

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/username/reponame
```

Then add this module to your required modules in `config.toml`.

```toml
[module]

[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-opensearch"
disable = false
ignoreConfig = false
ignoreImports = false

```

The next time you run `hugo` it will download the latest version of the module.

## Updating

```bash
# update this module
hugo mod get -u github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-opensearch
# update to a specific version
hugo mod get -u github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-opensearch@v1.0.0
# update all modules recursively over the whole project
hugo mod get -u ./...
```

<!--- INSTALLUPDATE END --->

## Configuration

Add OpenSearch to your home output formats. You should already have an `[outputs]` section, add `"OpenSearch"` to it. Add them only to the `home` parameter.

```toml
[outputs]
home = [ ... others ... , "OpenSearch" ]
```

This will add a `opensearch.xml` to your Website. You should now add a meta tag to your header that helps with automatically finding this file:

```gotemplate
{{ partial "head/opensearch.html" . }}
```

‚ùóPlease note, that this module adds custom media types and output formats. If you use anything else than `_merge = "deep"` in the `[outputFormats]` and `[mediaTypes]` sectiona of your configuration then you will have to add these types manually.

The following configuration parameters are available in `site.Params.dnb.opensearch`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | Search title. MUST be shorter than 16 characters and MUST NOT contain markup. Default is `site.Title`. |
| `description` | Search description, MUST be shorter than 1024 characters and MUST NOT contain markup. Default is `Search on {{ site.Title }}`. |
| `query_url` | Url to the search result page. Replace the location of the searchterm with `{searchterms}`. Default is `search/?q={searchTerms}`. This variable will be prefixed with the `baseUrl` |
| `search_form` | Url to the search form. Default is `search/`. This variable will be prefixed with the `baseUrl` and is used by Firefox to link to the page with the search form. |
| `output_encoding` | Encoding of the output of the search. Default is `UTF-8`. |
| `input_encoding` | Encoding of the input of the search. Default is `UTF-8`. |
| `enable_autoupdate` | Enable auto update for the search update. Default is `true`. At this time, addons.mozilla.org (AMO) doesn't support automatic updating of OpenSearch plugins. If you want to put your search plugin on AMO, then set this parameter to `false`. |
| `hookLink` | Link to the component's README file for warnings and errors. |
